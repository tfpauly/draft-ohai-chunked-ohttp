I understand that Tommy discovered a few like this after implementing and deploying this.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if such an approach would be possible or beneficial for the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nHTTP/2 and HTTP/3 allows clients a issue large number of requests at once (e.g., 100). But servers often do not process all requests in parallel. It is often the case that the number of requests that are processed concurrently is rather small (e.g., 10), while other requests are \"buffered.\" By doing so, the backend applications are protected from DoS attacks, while the bandwidth of the connection is fully utilized.\r\n\r\nTo paraphrase, the ability to buffer requests is a key pillar of HTTP/2 and 3. It is not a misfeature.\r\n\r\nCONNECT and extended CONNECT are exceptions. That is fine, because every intermediary would recognize that they are exceptions. When receiving too many requests at once, they have the option to respond with 429 Too Many Requests.\r\n\r\nBut POST does not work like that. Proxies are designed to be transparent to the content-type being used.\r\n\r\nThe problem with current design is that it requires proxies to have a list of mime types that have to be processed like CONNECT. I do not see a reason to choose such an approach when we can choose to use extended CONNECT that provides the necessary semantics.",

Apache HTTP server + mod_php) is to use Nginx as a buffer for reducing concurrency. Preforking servers cannot handle as many connections as a event-driven server does. Therefore, it makes (or made) sense to let Nginx to buffer highly concurrent but slowly arriving requests until the entire request is received. Once each request is received completely, Nginx opens a connection to the backend and starts forwarding the request.\r\n\r\nProxies do provide knobs for changing the behavior. In case of Nginx, the knob is [`proxy_request_buffering`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_request_buffering). But the default is `on`, meaning that Nginx will try to buffer the entire request.\r\n\r\n@tfpauly \r\n> My initial inclination is to interpret this how @martinthomson does \u2014 essentially, that while POST clients \"cannot rely on incremental delivery\" in general, specific services can indeed provide incremental delivery where it is beneficial and desirable.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I agree with the interpretation considering that the MUST NOT in RFC 9205 section 3.1 follows this sentence: _This split between generic and application-specific semantics allows an HTTP message to be handled by common software (e.g., HTTP servers, intermediaries, client implementations, and caches) **without requiring those implementations to understand the application in use**_ (emphasis mine).\r\n\r\nBut even if we ignore RFC 9205, I'm still stuck with [this question](https://github.com/ietf-wg-ohai/draft-ohai-chunked-ohttp/issues/19#issuecomment-2026468705).\r\n\r\nTo me, all the argument to use HTTP POST for Chunked OHTTTP seem to be equally applicable to WebSockets over H2/H3, masque, or connect-tcp. The arguments can be (or could have been) used to say that masque or connect-tcp should be built on top of HTTP POST, because the servers / intermediaries could be configured to start forwarding bytes without buffering at a per-resource basis.\r\n\r\nBut we chose to use extended CONNECT. Is there a reason to believe that for POST is a better choice for Chunked OHTTP while extended CONNECT is (was) a better choice for WebSockets over H2/H3, masque, and connect-udp?",
